/*Repeat the coin exercise from HW2, but modify your program to 1) be a function that takes one argument â€“ the number 
of heads in a row you'd like to flip and then 2) modify your code to use this argument to allow a variable number of 
heads in a row to be chosen. E.g.  coinToss(8); will flip the coin until 8 heads in a row are obtained.   
You should print out the number of heads in a row you are seeking and the total number of flips it took. */
